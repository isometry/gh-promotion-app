## How it works

The `gh-promotion-app` is a service that automates the promotion of GitHub branch across environments. It is designed to
operate as a GitHub App and respond to the webhook events to which its App is subscribed.
It currently supports the following event types:

| Event Type            | Description                                     |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `push`                | Change is pushed to a given branch              |
| `pull_request`        | Pull request is opened, closed, or synchronized |
| `pull_request_review` | Pull request review is submitted                |
| `check_suite`         | Check suite is completed                        |
| `deployment_status`   | Deployment status is completed                  |
| `status`              | When the status of a Git commit changes         |
| `workflow_run`        | Workflow run is completed                       |
